Dear Kriszti√°n,

Since this was my first ever Angular project I stayed with the approach of having the template and the styles in the same file. I know that moving the templates and the styles into seperate files is a better practice, but for now, I stayed with this approach.

You can run the frontend with npm start and the backend with npm run dev

The line chart is missing, I'm adding that feature right now, and will push my changes as soon as I'm done with it.

Thanks for your patience,

Bence
